          - P-value
          - Scatterplots with fitted lines

    - Model Development, Evaluation and Refinement.

      - Linear Regression (Building, testing and evaluation of the model)
      - Multiple Linear Regression (Feature selection; Building, testing and evaluation of the model)
      - Polynomial Regression (Finding out optimal order for model; Pipelines; Building, testing and evaluation of the model)
